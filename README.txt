This code is merely a backend sudoku solver implemented entirely in Java.
It utilizes concepts such as (backtracking, recursion and ADTs).
For a user to get a sudoku grid solved, he/she needs to enter the grid cellwise starting by upper row, moving from left to right and then from up to down(If a cell is empty, zero should be entered)
